<marquee behavior="scroll">The meanest dog you'll ever meet
He ain't the hound dog in the street
He bares some teeth and tears some skin
But brother, that's the worst of him
The dog you really got to dread
Is the one that howls inside your head
It's him whose howling drives men mad

Who are you to lead them?
Who are you to think that you can hold your head up
higher than your fellow man?
